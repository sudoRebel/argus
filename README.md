# 🖥️ Linux Task Manager (CLI)

A lightweight, interactive, high-performance Linux Command-Line Task Manager written in standard C++. It interacts directly with the Linux Kernel via the `/proc` pseudo-filesystem to monitor active processes and manage them using POSIX system signals.

---

# ✨ Features
* **Zero-Dependency**: Standard C++ library only.
* **Kernel Direct-Access**: Reads directly from the `/proc` filesystem.
* **PID Mapping**: Identifies active processes.
* **Interactive CLI Interface**: Real-time process monitoring with custom action loops (Refresh/Exit).
* **Process Management**: Send kernel signals (`SIGKILL`) to terminate any task instantly via PID.
* **Smart Memory Auto-Scaling**: Displays memory consumption dynamically in Bytes, kB, MB, GB, TB, or PB based on real usage.
* **Crash Resilience**: Built-in exception handling to survive dynamic kernel thread shifts.

# 💡 How it works
1. **Discovery**: Scans the `/proc` directory for PID-named folders using `dirent.h`.
2. **Filtering**: Uses `isdigit()` to isolate system processes.
3. **Extraction**: Parses `/proc/[PID]/status` to retrieve the process name and RAM usage (`VmRSS`).
4. **Interactivity**: Captures user input to safely dispatch POSIX signals or trigger dynamic terminal redraws using `system("clear")`.
